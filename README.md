## Welcome 👋🏼

 
I am a incoming MSc Computer Science student at York University with research interests centered around artificial intelligence and quantum computing. I am particularly interested in problems pertaining to self-supervised learning, applications of AI in medicine, and the application of deep learning in quantum computing (e.g., VQAs).
