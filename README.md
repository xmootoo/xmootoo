## Welcome 👋🏼
 
I'm Xavier, a published mathematician with a background in classical music, now focused on machine learning and quantitative finance. My research focuses on machine learning methods for time series analysis, most recently on conformal prediction for uncertainty quantification, with work featured at NeurIPS and other several top-tier journals.
