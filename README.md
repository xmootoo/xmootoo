## Welcome 👋🏼
 
I am a MSc Computer Science student with a passion for all things deep learning. I enjoy working on deep learning methods for time series, explainable AI (XAI), and uncertainty quantification, with a focus on applications to healthcare. When I'm not working on research, you can find me in my home studio working on an R&B beat 🎶 or on the court playing tennis 🎾.
